Assignments performed by students for submission have a dual purpose. They are intended as educational devices, including the teaching of skills such as working in teams. They are also evaluation tools for the faculty in judging the quality of performance of individual students. Our policies are intended to balance these two purposes and, unless otherwise stated, these policies apply to all assignments. Students currently taking this class can work together to conceptualize general approaches to assignments. However, unless otherwise specified for a particular assignment, the work you submit should be done completely on your own. This includes, numerical calculations, mathematical derivations, diagrams, graphs, computer programs, and output. Reference any written source you use in your submission, including Web sites. It is inappropriate to use assignments submitted in previous years as a source.

Assignments from this and past years are presented below, with selected examples and solutions. All student work is courtesy of the student named and used with permission.
